First part of the code (brain decoding and fingerprinting with SDI): 


- run script LDA_SDI/LDA_SDI_FullPipeline.m

- allows to perform ANOVA, LDA classifications for brain decoding and fingerprinting, with the choice on SDI values or FC node strengths.

-takes data directly from the folder Data



Second part of the code (PLS relating SDI and cognitive scores):


- this part requires the PLS implementation developed at the MIP:Lab - EPFL ( https://github.com/danizoeller/myPLS ). Download the myPLS code from the GitHub repository and copy the downloaded folder 'myPLS-master' to Code_For_Publication/PLS_SDI

- run script PLS_SDI/PLS_SDI_FullPipeline.m  

- allows to perform PLS analysis for SDI values and cognitive scores, with the choice on SDI values from one of the 8 tasks, and the pie charts of Figure 4c

- takes data directly from the folder Data
