# LDA_SDI

Implementation of brain decoding, fingerprinting and behavior multivariate correlation analysis from Structural-Decoupling Index (SDI) data, as described in:

> **Structure-function interplay as signature for brain decoding and fingerprinting**  
> *Alessandra Griffa, Enrico Amico, Raphaël Liégeois, Dimitri Van De Ville, Maria Giulia Preti*  
> bioRxiv 2021.04.19.440314; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.19.440314


The SDI quantifies the degree of structure-function dependency for each brain region, and it has been defined in previous work:

> **Decoupling of brain function from structure reveals regional behavioral specialization in humans**  
> *Maria Giulia Preti, Dimitri Van De Ville*

## Code implementation

LDI_SDI is a collection of **Matlab** scripts.
